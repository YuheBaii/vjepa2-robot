# V-JEPA 2

A frontier video understanding model developed by FAIR, Meta, which extends the pretraining objectives of [VJEPA](https://ai.meta.com/blog/v-jepa-yann-lecun-ai-model-video-joint-embedding-predictive-architecture/), resulting in state-of-the-art video understanding capabilities, leveraging data and model sizes at scale.
The code is released [in this repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vjepa2).

## Installation

To run V-JEPA 2 model, ensure you have installed the latest transformers:

```bash
pip install -U git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers
```

## Intended Uses

V-JEPA 2 is intended to represent any video (and image) to perform video classification, retrieval, or as a video encoder for VLMs.

```python
from transformers import AutoVideoProcessor, AutoModel

hf_repo = "facebook/vjepa2-vith-fpc64-256"

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(hf_repo)
processor = AutoVideoProcessor.from_pretrained(hf_repo)
```

To load a video, sample the number of frames according to the model. For this model, we use 64.

```python
import torch
from torchcodec.decoders import VideoDecoder
import numpy as np

video_url = "https://huggingface.co/datasets/nateraw/kinetics-mini/resolve/main/val/archery/-Qz25rXdMjE_000014_000024.mp4"
vr = VideoDecoder(video_url)
frame_idx = np.arange(0, 64) # choosing some frames. here, you can define more complex sampling strategy
video = vr.get_frames_at(indices=frame_idx).data  # T x C x H x W
video = processor(video, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
with torch.no_grad():
    video_embeddings = model.get_vision_features(**video)

print(video_embeddings.shape)
```

To load an image, simply copy the image to the desired number of frames.

```python
from transformers.image_utils import load_image

image = load_image("https://huggingface.co/datasets/merve/coco/resolve/main/val2017/000000000285.jpg")
pixel_values = processor(image, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)["pixel_values_videos"]
pixel_values = pixel_values.repeat(1, 16, 1, 1, 1) # repeating image 16 times

with torch.no_grad():
    image_embeddings = model.get_vision_features(pixel_values)    

print(image_embeddings.shape)
```
